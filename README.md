# Face-Recognition

Performing Face Recognition on 10 Poplular Mens and Womens Tennis Players with OpennCv and Python.
The Players lists includes Andy Murray, Rodger Federrer, Rafael Nadal, Dominic Thiem, Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka, Petra Kivitova, Simona Halep, Ashleigh Barty

To perform the main face recognition task, [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) library is used.

face_recognition library provides simple methods to recognize and manipulate faces with pytho. It is built using [dlib's](http://dlib.net/) state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning.

A great tutorial on performing face recognition can be found at [pyimagesearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/06/18/face-recognition-with-opencv-python-and-deep-learning/), and this repo is based on the same blog post.
